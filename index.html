            <h2>His Story</h2>
            <p>He stepped away from the mic. This was the best take he had done so far, but something seemed missing. Then it struck him all at once. Visuals ran in front of his eyes and music rang in his ears. His eager fingers went to work in an attempt
                to capture his thoughts hoping the results would produce something that was at least half their glory.
            </p>
            <p>They argue. While the argument seems to be different the truth is it's always the same. Yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing. They both knew it, but neither has
                the courage or strength to address the underlying issue. So they continue to argue.
            </p>
            <h3>THE LAST STEP WASN'T THE MOST IMPORTANT. IT WAS THE NEXT STEP THAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT.</h3>

            <p>There was something beautiful in his hate. It wasn't the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance. It was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate, he didn't understand where it came from.
                It was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him.
            </p>
            <p>She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. It was something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything. He told her that she had it
                wrong. The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't the most important. It was the next step that was the most important.</p>

                The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember. In fact, it was difficult for anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared. It had seemed they'd always been there and yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had removed them
                was a question that had been asked time and again, but while they all thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it. So, the shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but perfectly normal in another.

                Bob knew there was a correct time and place to reveal his secret and this wasn't it. The issue was that the secret might be revealed despite his best attempt to keep it from coming out. At this point, it was out of his control and completely dependant
                on those around him who also knew the secret. They wouldn't purposely reveal it, or at least he believed that, but they could easily inadvertently expose it. It was going to be a long hour as he nervously eyed everyone around the table
                hoping they would keep their mouths shut.
